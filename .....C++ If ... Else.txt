                                                     .....C++ If ... Else

.....C++ Conditions and If Statements.....
You already know that C++ supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
Equal to a == b
Not Equal to: a != b
You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

C++ has the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
The if Statement
Use the if statement to specify a block of C++ code to be executed if a condition is true.

Syntax'''
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

In the example below, we test two values to find out if 20 is greater than 18. If the condition is true, print some text:

Example=
if (20 > 18) {
  cout << "20 is greater than 18";
}

We can also test variables:

Example=
int x = 20;
int y = 18;
if (x > y) {
  cout << "x is greater than y";
}

                                                                 C++ Else If


//The else if Statement Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

Syntax::
if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
Example
int time = 22;
if (time < 10) {
  cout << "Good morning.";
} else if (time < 20) {
  cout << "Good day.";
} else {
  cout << "Good evening.";
}
// Outputs "Good evening."
