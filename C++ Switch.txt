                                                                            C++ Switch

C++ Switch Statements....
Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

Syntax:::
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
.....This is how it works:

1.The switch expression is evaluated once
2.The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case
3.If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed
4.The break and default keywords are optional, and will be described later in this chapter
5.The example below uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

Example
int day = 4;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    cout << "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
    cout << "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    cout << "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    cout << "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    cout << "Friday";
    break;
  case 6:
    cout << "Saturday";
    break;
  case 7:
    cout << "Sunday";
    break;
}
// Outputs "Thursday" (day 4)


                                                The break Keyword

When C++ reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.

When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.
